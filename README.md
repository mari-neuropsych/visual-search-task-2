# Visual Search Task 2

Idea:  
A GUI program for a Visual Search Task, where participants locate a target shape or color among distractors, testing selective attention and perceptual speed.

Objective:  
- Demonstrate understanding of attention, perception, and search strategies.  
- Collect reaction time, accuracy, and search efficiency.  
- Practice GUI programming and cognitive experiment design.

How it works:  
The program displays a grid of shapes/colors. Participants must click on the target shape/color as quickly and accurately as possible. Reaction time and correctness are recorded.

Usage:  
Run the script in Python. Click on the target stimulus as fast as you can. Results will be printed in the console.
